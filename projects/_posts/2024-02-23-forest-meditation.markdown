In association with Elizabeth Chapin’s Treespell

February 9, 2024
Women and Their Work Gallery
Hilton and Chou respond to Elizabeth Chapin’s Treespell exhibit, using electronic and acoustic sounds to engage the audience in a meditative environment.

About Treepsell: A commentary on today’s crowded visual culture and the growing sense of separation between humans and nature, Chapin’s work reflects and rejects the ways in which the modern world has turned away from nature and toward a constant influx of digital visual information. Treespell is an overarching story about this mutual spell that we’re all involved in; we become ‘beasted’ when we become separate from nature. Chapin’s colorful paintings of trees, which she approaches with the specific and thoughtful care usually reserved for portraiture, remind us of the value of returning our time, attention, and gaze back toward the natural world.
