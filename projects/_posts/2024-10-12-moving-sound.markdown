### Second Saturdays are for Families @ Laguna Gloria
#### The Contemporary Austin

"Moving Sound" is a site specific, one-day interactive experience focusing on electronic & interactive sound technologies.

It will guide patrons through a multi-sensory experience, encouraging them to interact with live video feed that allows them to gesturally manipulate multiple elements of an ambient soundscape and music, in part referencing the works of Laurie Spiegel and Atau Tanaka.
