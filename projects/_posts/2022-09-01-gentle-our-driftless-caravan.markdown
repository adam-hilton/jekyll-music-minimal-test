Rain Lily Farm | Austin, TX
Gentle our Driftless Caravan was a reverie contemplating bereavement, lassitude, and water— untenable to the experience— with its dichotomies as essence of life and a prevailing force of nature. Performed by dancers Alexa Capareda, Siri Cyan, Taryn Lavery, Clay Moore and Oddalys Salcido, with a live score by Henna Chou and Adam Hilton, set design by Ia Ensterä and lighting design by Natalie George Productions.

Choreographic Direction: Alexa Capareda, Taryn Lavery, Alex Miller Dance Collaboration & Performance: Alexa Capareda, Siri Cyan, Taryn Lavery, Clay Moore, Oddalys Salcido Set Design: Ia Ensterä Lighting Design: Natalie George Productions Costumes: Alexa Capareda, Taryn Lavery (additional fabrication), Alex Miller Executive Production: En Route Productions

“The score and choreography combine to suggest big emotions— separation, grief, love— and the farm setting roots the piece in a deep sense of place. It is spectacular and meditative, intimate and grand— triumphantly full of contradictions that work.” - Courtney Thomas, SIGHTLINES Magazine
